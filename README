a super simple shell for picloud.

Make sure that your environment has PICLOUD_KEY and PICLOUD_SECRET defined

examples:

    local$ ./picloud-shell.py
    $ pwd
    /home/emp9
    $ echo "hello world" > shared/file
    $ CTRL+C
    local$ ./picloud-shell.py cat shared/file
    hello world
    local$ ./picloud-shell.py "cd shared; cat file"
    hello world

cd doesn't work because your environment isn't saved between executions.
however, you can do stuff like this:

cd shared; echo "hello world" > file; cat file

I tried to fix this by saving the environment between calls, but it isn't
simple.

* allow & symbol to wait to return results
